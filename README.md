# Deepfake Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on deepfake detection using deep learning techniques. The work builds upon the concepts presented in the paper:

**"Deepfake Detection Using Deep Learning Methods: A Systematic and Comprehensive View"**

Through extensive experimentation and testing with multiple deep learning architectures, a modified hybrid model was designed. The final architecture combines the strengths of different models and best fits the objective of reliably detecting deepfakes.

## Model Architecture
- Based on insights from the referenced paper, the architecture was adapted and optimized.
- Several variations were tested, including CNN-based and transformer-based designs.
- The final solution is a hybrid model that achieved improved accuracy and robustness.

## Features
- End-to-end pipeline for training and testing deepfake detection models.
- Hybrid architecture tailored for real-world performance.
- Adaptable codebase for experimenting with different datasets and models.


## Results
- The hybrid model demonstrated improved accuracy compared to individual baseline models.
- Results show strong generalization across multiple datasets.
